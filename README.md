# Natural-Language-Understanding-for-Dialog-Systems-Assignment
The goal of this assignment is to develop a natural language understanding (NLU) module for a dialog system (chatbot) that can handle user inputs in a specific domain (e.g., travel, e-commerce). The intern will build models to recognize intents, extract entities, and handle contextual understanding to guide the dialog system's responses.
